		\subsection{Spotify, Discover Weekly, Spotify's API}
        In recent years Spotify 

        "Discover Weekly is a personalized playlist with 30 old and new songs Spotify thinks youâ€™ve never heard of, updated every Monday. The songs are personalized for each user so no one user has the same Discover Weekly playlist (unless you freakishly have the exact same likes/dislikes/behaviors as someone else)." - "Your weekly mixtape of fresh music. Enjoy new discoveries and deep cuts chosen just for you. Updated every Monday, so save your favourites! - Spotify"
